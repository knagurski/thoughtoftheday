# Thought of the day

Since starting to use Slack, I've been putting out the odd _Thought of the day_
post to explore subjects from tech and web development, to history and more than
one inane rambling. The aim of this repository is to give these thoughts a more
permanent place to live.

Nothing fancy, just a few _thoughts of the day_.

If you like it, cool.

## What else is it?
I'm a web developer and I enjoy playing about with new technologies and
techniques, so this will also function as a playground.

At the moment _Thought of the day_ is written in the following technologies:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com)

But I'll be throwing in some more stuff when the fancy takes me.
