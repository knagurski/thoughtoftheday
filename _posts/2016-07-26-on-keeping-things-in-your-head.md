  Writing tickets that are useful is difficult
---
Sorry if this one gets a bit techie for those who are not so inclined. I like me
some processes, but only to the extent that they ​_help_​, not hold you back.
Before I came here, I treated my Jira tickets as pretty much just a to-do list.
Detail was lacking beyond a few bullet points. The entire idea was that when I
came to actually ​_doing_​ the thing, I’d look at the ticket and use the bullet
points to jog my memory. I think a lot of us work in a similar way... if you
really go into proper detail, you might as well just do the damn thing at the
time!

But I’ve changed how I look at these things now. I’ve been in large teams and
small and just on my own at various points in my career. When I was on my own,
the idea that I would remember it was fine, but being in a team that is expected
to deliver regardless of my attendance (or mental faculties) means that when it
comes down to actually actioning that ticket that was created 2-3 months ago, it
might not be me who is driving the keyboard. Beyond that, when we’ve got
literally hundreds of tickets at various stages, having actionable info on any
given one at any time is a long-shot; we just can’t keep that kinda info in our
heads.

So then, what’s the ideal amount of detail to go into in a ticket? No idea, this
is a thought, not a tutorial.
