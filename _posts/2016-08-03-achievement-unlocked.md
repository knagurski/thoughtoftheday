  I talk about why starting a new project was important to me and how I see
  things going.

A little while ago, a co-worker decided to take it upon himself to setup a new
Slack team. I'd been hearing good things about the communication app of choice
for hipsters and startups, so I was intrigued and gave it a go. But what to
write? There was some idle chit-chat and a bit of work related back and forth,
but what it really needed was some _sizzle_!

## Enter _Thought of the day_
_Thought of the day_ started out with an in-depth pondering of the chucking
capabilities of the average woodchuck. Another day I delved into an essay about
how you needed to know what you didn't know so you could know what to do to
figure out what to know to know what you needed to know.

When I skipped a day, I was surprised to hear other members of staff saying they
missed my thought. So I tried to make a bit of an effort.

Things took a more serious turn with a discussion of Jira tickets and how much
information to include to make them useful, but not so specific as to rule out
better solutions. At the 100th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme, I tried
to wrap my head around the sacrifices made by soldiers who were really just
kids.

Later I drew a parallel between a project's popularity and the ability to get
things done, siting the different approaches of the Angular 2 project and PHP,
and highlighting the issues that changing the design of the 20p coin could
cause.

So things have run the gamut.

## So why start a site?
Good question, thanks for asking. I'm the kinda guy who loves technology and has
a real interest in web development as well as history. Thoughts of the day in
Slack were really just a place to do a quick mind-dump. But over the last few
weeks, I felt that I wanted to expand on my thoughts and find a more permanent
home for them.

So with a love of web development and passion for pondering, what better way to
scratch both itches than to create a site to record my inane ramblings, whilst
giving me a place to experiment with new tools and techniques?

## So how is this going to play out?
Man, you are full of great questions! I plan to release a few _Thoughts of the
day_ a week, or really whenever the urge takes me. Some of these thoughts will
be whitty one-liners. Others will be serious discussions of serious topics for
serious people. Most will be little things that amuse me.

Tech-wise I'm going to start small. Version 1 will have only very basic features
and look pretty crappy. But over time I plan to play about with some CSS
techniques and look into pushing my posts to Slack, Facebook and Twitter, coz
why not?
